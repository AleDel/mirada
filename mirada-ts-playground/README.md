## TODO

- [ ] since we are compiling TS when executing that affects speed perception - perhaps we could compile incrementally when user stops editing so when clicking execute is already compiled or in progress?
- [x] build a onMouseMove experience to test real time (I decided to do this in the other project mirada-playground)
